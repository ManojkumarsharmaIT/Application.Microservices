This repository contains an **E-Commerce application built with Microservices architecture** using **.NET 8**, developed as part of a Udemy course.  

The project demonstrates how to design and implement multiple microservices with **clean architecture**, **authentication & authorization**, **async messaging with Azure Service Bus**, and an **API Gateway with Ocelot**.

## üöÄ Project Overview  

Traditional **monolithic applications** often face scalability, maintainability, and deployment challenges.  
This project showcases how to overcome these issues using **Microservices Architecture** in the .NET ecosystem.  

You‚Äôll find **7 fully working microservices**, communication patterns (sync/async), and best practices for building robust enterprise-level applications.

## üß© Microservices Implemented  

- **Product Microservice** ‚Äì Manage products catalog  
- **Coupon Microservice** ‚Äì Handle discount codes  
- **Shopping Cart Microservice** ‚Äì Add/remove products from cart  
- **Order Microservice** ‚Äì Manage customer orders  
- **Payment Microservice** ‚Äì Process payments  
- **Email Microservice** ‚Äì Send notifications/emails  
- **.NET Identity Microservice** ‚Äì Authentication & Role-based Authorization  

### Supporting Projects
- **Ocelot API Gateway** ‚Äì Entry point for client communication  
- **MVC Web Application** ‚Äì Frontend built with ASP.NET Core MVC + Bootstrap 5

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **.NET 8** (APIs & MVC)  
- **Entity Framework Core** (SQL Server)  
- **Azure Service Bus** (Topics & Queues)  
- **Ocelot API Gateway**  
- **.NET Identity** (Authentication & Role-based Authorization)  
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** (API documentation)  
- **Clean Architecture + Repository Pattern**  
- **Bootstrap 5** (UI)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Cloud Deployment  

I also learned and implemented **Azure Cloud services** to deploy this project:  

- **Azure App Service** ‚Äì Published the microservices and MVC Web App  
- **Azure SQL Database** ‚Äì Hosted databases for each microservice  
- **Azure Service Bus** ‚Äì Used for asynchronous communication between microservices  
- **CI/CD with Azure App Service** ‚Äì Deployed directly from Visual Studio  

This gave me real-world experience in deploying and running microservices in a cloud environment.
